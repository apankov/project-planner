/**
 * Parent/child structure for the Gantt.
 *
 * A task can sit inside another one, and the relationship is stored on the
 * child (see `task-parent`). This module is where a flat list of rows becomes
 * a tree: it works out who really is whose parent, gives a task with children
 * a bar spanning everything beneath it, and flattens the tree back into the
 * lines the chart draws, leaving out whatever is hidden inside a collapsed
 * parent.
 *
 * Everything here treats the stored relationships as untrusted. A vault is
 * hand-edited text: a task can name itself as its parent, two tasks can name
 * each other, a chain can loop back on itself after five hops, and a parent
 * can name an ID that no longer exists or that the current filter has taken
 * off screen. None of those may hang the view or lose a row, so every one of
 * them resolves the same way — the link that cannot be honoured is dropped and
 * the task stands as a root. A user who has written a loop still sees all of
 * their tasks; they just do not see the loop.
 *
 * Nothing recurses. Depth is bounded only by how many tasks a vault has, and a
 * long enough chain would overflow the stack on a recursive walk, so the tree
 * is built, rolled up and flattened with explicit loops.
